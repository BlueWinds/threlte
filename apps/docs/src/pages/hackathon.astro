        welcome participants of all levels, coming as individuals or teams. Both tracks will have
        the same prizes too.

          <p class="text-faded text-base font-normal">
            The "Aha! Track" is where you share the knowledge with the community. What did you miss
            when you were learning Threlte? Add that example that delights and explains, or a
            tutorial that gets you set up with the skills for your next project. Let's make Threlte
            easy and fun to learn for anybody!

      <h2>Judging</h2>
      <p>
        The Threlte core team will act as judges, each casting their scores on a 1-5 range for each
        criteria. If there is a conflict of interest individual judges may recuse themselves for
        fairness sake. The total score will determine the winner in each track.
