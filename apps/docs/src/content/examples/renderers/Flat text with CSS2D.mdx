In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of running an additional Three.js renderer in parallel with Threlte's `<Canvas>`, while still leveraging Threlte's built-in elements. Specifically, you'll learn how to run CSS2DRenderer to add flat labels to objects in a three-dimensional scene.

This example can be easily adapted to use CSS3DRenderer instead, if you want the elements to live "inside" the scene, rather than flat across the surface.

<Example path="renderers/CSS2DRenderer" />

## How does it work?

In this scene, we run two renderers - the default one provided by threlte, and also a new CSS2DRenderer which we'll initialize. Threlte's renderer runs on a canvas element as normal, while our new renderer runs in a `<div>` with absolute positioning on top of it.

### The render loop

To integrate the a new renderer into svelte's loop, we call it inside `useRender()` after the tick.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  const element = document.querySelector('#css-renderer-target')
  const cssRenderer = new CSS2DRenderer({ element })

  const { size } = useThrelte()
  $: cssRenderer.setSize($size.width, $size.height)

  useRender(async (ctx) => {
    await tick()
    ctx.renderer?.render(ctx.scene, ctx.camera.current)
    cssRenderer.render(ctx.scene, ctx.camera.current)
  })
</script>
```

This ensures that both renderers execute on each loop, after the scene updates.

### Setting up CssObject

The other integral part is a component that accepts DOM contents in the default slot and places them in the scene and renders them with the THREE.CSS2DRenderer:

```svelte title="CssObject.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { CSS2DObject } from 'three/examples/jsm/renderers/CSS2DRenderer'

  export let pointerEvents = false

  let element

  const cssobject = (node) => {
    element = node
    return {
      destroy() { element = undefined }
    }
  }
</script>

<div
  use:cssobject
  style:pointer-events={pointerEvents ? 'auto' : 'none !important'}
  style:will-change="transform"
>
  <slot />
</div>

{#if element}
  <T {...$$restProps} is={CSS2DObject} args={[element]} let:ref>
    <slot name="three" {ref} />
  </T>
{/if}
```

This component renders children into a div, and hooks that into Threlte's internals by using `<T is={CSS2DObject}>`. It passes all other properties through, letting us use it like so:

```svelte

<CssObject position={[-1, 2, 1]} center={[0, 0.5]}>
  <button on:click={clickHello}>
    Hello - {helloCount}
  </button>
</CssObject>
```
