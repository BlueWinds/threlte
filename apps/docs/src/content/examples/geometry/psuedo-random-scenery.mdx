Ok. Where to begin.
simple first.
flat plane with random scenery objects. done.
now a flat plane with scenery objects that appear random.

- generate some random numbers from Math.random() and save them into a js file

This follows along after creating some terrain. The motivation here is that I want to add things to my terrain.

<Example path="geometry/psuedo-random-scenery" />

### How is this done?

<Tip type="tip">This is just a tip</Tip>

```svelte
<T.Mesh
	{geometry}
	rotation.x={DEG2RAD * -90}
>
```

what about this?
