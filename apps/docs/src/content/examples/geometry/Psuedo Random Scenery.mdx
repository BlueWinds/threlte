Examples of psudeo scenery and how to accomplish that in Threlte.

Within your scene, suppose you've decided you'd like some randomly generated objects. Here we're going to explore some of the ways you could do that and hopefully give you a place you can build from on your own.

<Tip type="note">Explicitly placing objects is also a good enough approach in many projects.</Tip>

A simple starting point is complete randomness. Below is a flat plane, a couple of `{#each ... as ...}` blocks and a function call to create a bunch of random numbers which sets up the objects within the scene.

If you play around with regenerating the scene above you'll start to notice an issue.

- Sometimes some trees are placed too close to one-another, or maybe a tree looks like its growing from a rock. This is especially true with a high number of objects.

A solution for this is to use Poisson Disk Sampling.

- Technically, the `Math.random()` function is completely random. So if you ever wanted multiplayer your players will see different scenery.

- generate some random numbers from Math.random() and save them into a js file
  This follows along after creating some terrain. The motivation here is that I want to add things to my terrain.

### How is this done?

<Tip type="info">This is just a tip</Tip>

```svelte
<T.Mesh
	{geometry}
	rotation.x={DEG2RAD * -90}
>
```

what about this?
