Within your scene, suppose you've decided you'd like some randomly generated objects. Here you can explore some of the ways you could do that and hopefully find a place you'd like to build from on your own.

<Tip type="note">
  Explicitly placing objects is also a good enough approach in many projects. You could even start
  from a random scene, then save all the object properties and create a svelte file representing the
  randomly generated scene.
</Tip>

A simple starting point is complete randomness. Below is a flat plane, a couple of `{#each ... as ...}` blocks and a function call to create a bunch of random numbers to pass onto the objects within the scene.

This could be all you need for your project.

If not and you noticed some placement issues i.e. sometimes some trees are placed too close to one-another, or maybe a tree looks like its growing from a rock; then you need a better solution.

[Poisson Disk Sampling](https://medium.com/@hemalatha.psna/implementation-of-poisson-disc-sampling-in-javascript-17665e406ce1) is an algorithm you can use to solve this and it will be used below, though it's details won't be discussed here.

Excellent, now you have a bunch of points that are a minimum distance apart. If you reduce the `min Distance Between Objects` to something smaller than your objects size there will still be collisions. In the case of the bushes above it still looks good.

TODO:

You could leave the algorithm as is if it suits your project. Below I've adjusted the algorithms implementation to allow for some variation in the distances between the points. Doing so means you can distinguish between points that should map to larger or smaller objects without collision.

THEN:

- Make the randomness consistent?
- making zones of objects by incorporating noise functions

```svelte
<T.Mesh
	{geometry}
	rotation.x={DEG2RAD * -90}
