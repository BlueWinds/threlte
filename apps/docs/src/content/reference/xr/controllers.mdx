`<Controllers />` represents a THREE.XRTargetRaySpace, a THREE.XRGripSpace, and a controller model per each hand.

It can optionally accept children in `left` and `right` slots, which will replace the default controller model of the respective handedness.

```svelte
<Controllers>
  <T slot='left' is={$gltf1.scene} />
  <T slot='right' is={$gltf2.scene} />
</Controllers>
```
