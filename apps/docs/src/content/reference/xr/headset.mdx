`<Headset />` provides the ability to attach objects to the pose of the user's headset.

```svelte
<script>
  import { Headset } from '@threlte/xr'
  import { AudioListener } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

<Headset>
  <AudioListener />
</Headset>
```

Like a Portal, it can exist anywhere in your Threlte application.

`<Headset>` can sync with the current camera when not in an immersive XR session if the `syncCamera` property is added.

```svelte
<Headset syncCamera>
  <AudioListener />
</Headset>
```
