The `teleportControls` plugin creates teleportation controls similar to many native XR experiences: pressing the thumbstick forward on a controller will create a visible ray, and when the the thumbstick is released the user will be teleported to the end of the ray.

```svelte
<script>
  import { teleportControls } from '@threlte/xr'
  teleportControls()
</script>
```

Any mesh **within this component and all child components** can now be treated as a navigation mesh to which the user can teleport to.

To register a mesh with `teleportControls`, add a `teleportSurface` property.

```svelte
<T.Mesh teleportSurface>
  <T.CylinderGeometry args={[20, 0.01]} />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```

A mesh can also be registered as a `teleportBlocker`, meaning that it will prevent teleportation through it. 
This can be useful when creating walls and doors that the user must navigate around.

```svelte
<T.Mesh teleportBlocker>
  <T.BoxGeometry args={[0.8, 2, 0.1]} />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```

This plugin can be composed with the `teleportControls` plugin to allow both teleporting and interaction.

```svelte
<script>
  import { pointerControls, teleportControls } from '@threlte/xr'
  pointerControls()
  teleportControls()
</script>
```

This will result in `pointerControls` taking over when pointing at a mesh with events, and `teleportControls` taking over otherwise.
