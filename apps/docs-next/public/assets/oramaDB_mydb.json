It does this by leveraging the rigid three.js naming and object\nproperty structure to add and remove objects to and from the scene graph, attach\nobjects to parent object properties or add event listeners.\n\n<T> is the main building block of any Threlte application. Components available\nin '@threlte/extras' are built on top of <T> and may provide a more convenient\nAPI for specific three.js classes.\n\nPrimer on Terminology\n\nThere are two ways to use <T>:\n\nBoth ways are equivalent and can be used interchangeably. The latter is more\nexplicit and allows you to use any class definition (even if it’s not exported\nfrom Three.js’ main namespace 'three'), object instance or virtually any other\nvalue.\n\nThe next section will discuss both ways in more detail.\n\nAny three.js class available at Three.js’ main namespace 'three' can be used as\na component with full type-safety. The name of the import is the same as the\nname of the component. For example, the class THREE.Mesh can be used with the\ncomponent <T.Mesh>. Let’s take a look at a simple example:\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nIf you want to use a class that is not available at Three.js’ main namespace\n'three' with dot-notation, you can extend the default component catalogue. Be\naware that components used this way do not offer type-safety. Once extended, the\nupdated catalogue is available to all components in your application.\n\nTo explicitly pass a class definition to the component <T>, use the property is.\nLet’s take a look at the same example as above but using the property is:\n\nThe two examples are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.\n\nThe “vanilla” Three.js equivalent of both examples would be:\n\nUsing the property is comes in handy when using classes that are not exported\nfrom Three.js’ main namespace 'three', such as the OrbitControls class:\n\nIf a class definition such as THREE.Mesh is provided to the property is, it\ncreates an instance of that class which we call ref – the component’s reference\nto the three.js object:\n\nIf a class instance (such as new THREE.Mesh()) or any other value is provided,\nthe component uses this value as-is:\n\nDepending on the is property value types, Threlte makes certain assumptions:\n\nThe <T> component has a set of fixed props (namely args, is, attach, manual,\nmakeDefault and dispose) that are used to set up the Three.js object. On top of\nthat, you can use arbitrary props to reactively set any property of the\nunderlying Three.js object.\n\nTo understand how it works, let’s have a look at a simple example. Let’s say we\nwant to render a simple cube. We can do this by using the <T> component:\n\nUsing attachments [/docs/reference/core/t#attach], the geometry as well as the\nmaterial are assigned to the mesh. What if we want to change the color of the\nmaterial to \"red\"? We can do this by using the color prop:\n\nKeep in mind that this property is not hard-wired. We can use any property of\nthe underlying Three.js object as a prop on the <T> component. For example, we\ncan also set the position property of the THREE.Mesh:\n\nBecause the property position of a THREE.Mesh is a THREE.Vector3 the value we\nhave to provide is what is passed to the set function of the THREE.Vector3\nclass. In this case, we pass an array of three numbers ([x, y, z]). Using an\neditor like VS Code, you benefit from type hints and auto-completion.\n\nWe only changed the y coordinate of the position, so we can use a pierced prop\nto only change the y coordinate:\n\nThis way, we get less updates of the underlying Three.js object because the\nvalue of the prop is a primitive value which can easily be compared to the\nprevious value. Unfortunately with pierced props we miss out on the type hints\nand auto-completion.\n\nThree.js objects are class instances. When Instantiating these objects, they can\nreceive one-time constructor arguments (new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32)). In\nThrelte, constructor arguments are always passed as an array via the property\nargs. If args change later on, the object must naturally get reconstructed from\nscratch!\n\nUse attach to bind objects to their parent. If you unmount the attached object\nit will be taken off its parent automatically.\n\nThe following attaches a material to the material property of a mesh and a\ngeometry to the geometry property:\n\nAll objects ending with “Material” (such as MeshStandardMaterial) receive\nattach=\"material\", and all objects ending with “Geometry” receive\nattach=\"geometry\" automatically. You do not strictly have to type it out!\n\nBy default Threlte is responsive and will set up cameras properly on resize\n(aspect ratio etc). Cameras can be controlled manually by setting manual to\ntrue. This will opt out of projection matrix recalculation when the drawing area\nresizes or other camera-related properties change.\n\nUse the property makeDefault to set a camera to the default rendering camera.\n\nA common mistake is to forget setting makeDefault. If you do not set a camera to\nbe the default camera, the scene will not be rendered through this camera but\nthrough Threltes default camera.\n\nAdding an event listener to a component will also add the corresponding event\nlistener to the three.js class instance. The event will be forwarded and the\nnative payload is available as the first argument to the event listener.\n\nFor easier payload access as well as conforming to Three.js as much as possible,\nThrelte does not use Svelte’s CustomEvent<Payload> payload type. Instead, the\npayload is provided as is.\n\nThis will listen to the “change” event on the THREE.OrbitControls:\n\nAll <T> components also emit the create event when the underlying three.js class\ninstance is created. This can be used to access the instance from the parent\ncomponent or do tasks on the objects upon creation. The event handler is called\nwith an object containing a reference to the object as well as a function\ncleanup that you may invoke with a callback to clean up after the object is\ndestroyed when the component unmounts or the args change.\n\nThe value infered from the property is is available as the slot prop ref:\n\nThe value infered from the property is is available as the binding ref:\n\nBy default when using the dot-notation to access Three.js objects (e.g.\n<T.Mesh>), Threlte will automatically import the corresponding class from the\nnamespance 'three'. If you want to use a custom class or classes from Three.js\nthat are available elsewhere (like OrbitControls), you can extend the default\ncatalogue with the extend function:\n\nBe aware that in this case <T> can’t provide type-safety on properties and\nevents. If you need type-safety, you can use the is property instead: <T\nis={CustomMesh} />. This way, Threlte can infer the type of the object and\nprovide type-safety on properties and events."},"68571282-10":{"path":"/docs/reference/core/trait-components/","title":"ThrelteEnter Key","h1":"TRAIT COMPONENTS","content":"TRAIT COMPONENTS\n\nTrait components are mostly used internally and make certain aspects of three.js\nobjects accessible and reactive and interact with Threlte systems.

The most\nnotable one is probably the plugin interactivity\n[/docs/reference/extras/interactivity] that provides a way to interact with the\nscene.

Your editor should be able to provide you with the correct prop\ntypes for the components you’re using.\n\nInteractivity is now handled by a plugin that’s available at @threlte/extras.\nIt’s much more mature and flexible in terms of event handling. For instance – as\nsome of you requested – you may now define on what object the main event\nlistener is placed. Check out its documentation\n[/docs/reference/extras/interactivity] to learn more.\n\nThe hook useLoader [/docs/reference/core/hooks#useloader] now returns a custom\nSvelte store called AsyncWritable\n[/docs/reference/core/utilities#asyncwritable]. This store allows you to await\n[https://svelte.dev/tutorial/await-blocks] the loading of the resource while\nalso implementing a regular Svelte store. It also now caches the results of the\nloader function so that it’s not called multiple times for the same resource.\nYou will most likely benefit from quite a performance boost in applications that\nrely heavily on external resources.\n\nThe hook useThrelteRoot has been removed and its properties have partially been\nmerged into useThrelte as well as a new internal context which is not exposed.\nAll other contexts (which were used internally) have also been merged or\nremoved.\n\nIn the effort of clear separation of concerns, the component <Pass> as well as\nthe rendering with Three.js default EffectComposer have been removed. Threlte 6\nnow provides a hook called useRender [/docs/reference/core/hooks#userender]\nwhich allows you to easily set up sophisticated rendering pipelines. As soon as\na useRender hook is implemented, Threlte’s default render pipeline is disabled.\nuseRender callbacks will be invoked after all callback to useFrame have been\ninvoked. This means that you can use useFrame to update your objects and\nuseRender to render it. useRender also has the option of ordering callbacks to\norchestrate the rendering pipeline across multiple components.\n\nThelte’s main context contains Svelte stores. These stores are now a custom\nThrelte store called CurrentWritable\n[/docs/reference/core/utilities#currentwritable] which is a store that contains\na current value with a reference to the current value of the store. This means\nit does not need to be unwrapped manually (and expensively!) in non-reactive\nplaces such as loops. For instance, let’s have a look at its usage in the hook\nuseFrame [/docs/reference/core/hooks#useframe] where the context is available as\nthe first argument to the callback:\n\nThe full type definition is currently listed here\n[/docs/reference/core/hooks#usethrelte].\n\nThe signature of the hook useGltfAnimations has changed. It no longer provides a\ncallback that is invoked when the gltf store has been populated and the actions\nstore has been set. This is because it with the option to set a custom root for\nthe THREE.AnimationAction, the callback could be triggered multiple times,\nleading to an unpredictable behavior. You should reside to using the actions\nstore returned from the hook instead.\n\nCheck out the hooks documentation [/docs/reference/extras/use-gltf-animations]\nfor more information.\n\nIn an effort to clearly separate concerns, the components <Collider>,\n<AutoColliders> and <RigidBody> no longer offer transform props (position,\nrotation, scale and lookAt). Instead, you should wrap these components in for\ninstance <T.Group> components and apply transforms on these."},"68571282-96":{"path":"/docs/learn/advanced/plugins/","title":"ThrelteEnter Key","h1":"PLUGINS","content":"PLUGINS\n\nPlugins open up the component <T> to external code that will be injected via\ncontext into every child instance of a <T> component.\n\nIf a plugin decides via ref or props analysis that it doesn’t need to act in the\ncontext of a certain <T> component, it can return early.\n\nThe code of a plugin acts as if it would be part of the <T> component itself and\nhas access to all properties.

Threlte supports wheel, click and\npointer events through the plugin interactivity from '@threlte/extras' as well\nas the create event and arbitrary three.js object events on objects that extend\nTHREE.EventDispatcher (like OrbitControls). Click, pointer and wheel events\ncontain the native browser event as well as the raycast event data (object,\npoint, distance and other data).\n\nThe create event is triggered when the underlying three.js object is created in\na <T> component.\n\nSome three.js objects dispatch events such as the OrbitControls. To listen for\nthese events, use a regular Svelte event listener. The following example uses\nthe change event from OrbitControls\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls]\nto invalidate the renderer when the camera is moved.\n\nTo add click, pointer and wheel events to your Threlte app, import the plugin\ninteractivity from '@threlte/extras' and call it in your main scene component.\n\nAll child components now receive events.\n\nThe following interaction events are available:\n\nAll interaction events contain the following data:\n\nPropagation works a bit differently to the DOM because objects can occlude each\nother in 3D. The intersections array in the event data includes all objects\nintersecting the ray, not just the nearest. Only the first intersection with\neach object is included. The event is first delivered to the object nearest the\ncamera, and then bubbles up through its ancestors like in the DOM. After that,\nit is delivered to the next nearest object, and then its ancestors, and so on.\nThis means objects are transparent to pointer events by default, even if the\nobject handles the event.\n\nevent.stopPropagation() doesn’t just stop this event from bubbling up, it also\nstops it from being delivered to farther objects (objects behind this one). All\nother objects, nearer or farther, no longer count as being hit while the pointer\nis over this object. If they were previously delivered pointerover events, they\nwill immediately be delivered pointerout events. If you want an object to block\npointer events from objects behind it, it needs to have an event handler as\nfollows:\n\neven if you don’t want this object to respond to the pointer event. If you do\nwant to handle the event as well as using stopPropagation(), remember that the\npointerout events will happen during the stopPropagation() call. You probably\nwant your other event handling to happen after this.\n\nIf no event target is specified, all event handlers listen to events on the\ndomElement of the renderer (which is the canvas element by default). You can\nspecify a different target by passing a target prop to the interactivity plugin.\n\nIt’s also possible to change the target at runtime by updating the store target\nreturned from the interactivity plugin.\n\nIn the event that your event target is not the same size as the canvas, you can\npass a compute function to the interactivity plugin. This function receives the\nDOM event and the interactivity state and should set the pointer property of the\nstate to the pointer position in normalized device coordinates as well as set\nthe raycaster up for raycasting.\n\nYou can filter and sort events by passing a filter to the interactivity plugin.\nThe function receives all hits and the interactivity state and should return the\nhits that should be delivered to the event handlers in the order they should be\ndelivered.\n\nTo access the interactivity state, you can use the useInteractivity hook in any\nchild component of the component that implements the interactivity plugin as\nfollows:\n\nwhere this is the type of the interactivity state:\n\nCurrentWritable [/docs/reference/core/utilities#currentwritable] is a custom\nThrelte store.

These assets are loaded using the useLoader hook. Assets loaded via\nuseLoader are automatically cached and will not be loaded or parsed again if\nthey are already in the cache.\n\nThis section assumes you placed your assets in your public folder or in a place\nin your application where you can import them easily.\n\nModels of different 3D model extensions can be loaded with their respective\nloaders. For this guide, we’re going to use the GLTFLoader to load a .gltf\nmodel. In this section we’re also going to discuss a few things that are\nspecific to loading and caching models.\n\nWe start off by importing the GLTFLoader and useLoader hook:\n\nThen we can use the useLoader hook to load our model:\n\nAgain, the type of gltf is an AsyncWritable custom store. Its value will be\nundefined until the model has loaded. To use this model, we can use a\nconditional:\n\nWe included the <T> component here to add the model to our Threlte application\nbut immediately two problems arise:\n\nTo fix this, we’ll use Threlte’s CLI tool @threlte/gltf to generate a reusable\nSvelte component from our model.\n\nRun npx @threlte/gltf /path/to/model.gltf to generate a Svelte component from\nyour model. This will generate a file called Model.svelte in the same directory\nas your model. This is how a generated component looks like:\n\nThe generated component will still use the cache and will only reinstaniate\nparts of the model that make it reusable. This practice reduces network\nrequests, bandwidth, memory usage and improves the performance of your Threlte\napplication.\n\nYou can then import this component and use it in your application:\n\n@threlte/extras provides a handy hook for loading one-off .gltf models called\nuseGltf:\n\nKeep in mind that this hook caches the result and therefore is most suitable for\nloading models that are placed in the scene only once.\n\nTo start off, we import the TextureLoader from three and the useLoader hook from\n@threlte/core:\n\nThen we can use the useLoader hook to load our texture:\n\nThe type of texture is a custom store that Threlte provides called\nAsyncWritable. It’s very much like a regular Svelte store but with a few extra\nfeatures. Its value will be undefined until the texture has loaded. Once the\ntexture has loaded, the value will be the loaded texture. To use this texture on\na material, we can use a conditional:\n\nSince the underlying promise properties then and catch are exposed on the store\nitself, we can also make use of that and await the texture to be loaded:\n\nSome materials are composed of multiple textures for different material\nchannels. useLoader provides a way to load multiple textures at once and spread\nthe loaded textures on a material. Let’s say we want to load a texture for the\nmap and normalMap channels:\n\nWe can then spread the textures on a material via Svelte’s spread syntax:\n\nKeep in mind that the promise only resolves and the store gets populated once\nall textures have loaded.\n\nFor example, we may want to apply different textures to different faces of a\nBoxGeometry instance. To apply each texture to the corresponding face we can\npass a function to the attach prop:\n\n@threlte/extras provides a handy hook for loading textures called useTexture:\n\nThe hooks useLoader, useTexture and useGltf are context aware.

If\nyou are unsure about Svelte, consult its Tutorial [https://svelte.dev/tutorial]\nfor a quick introduction. As for Threejs, make sure you at least glance over its\nofficial documentation [https://threejs.org].\n\nAs a first step we’re creating a new Svelte file called App.svelte where we are\nimporting the <Canvas> component [/docs/reference/core/canvas].\n\nThe <Canvas> component is the root component of your Threlte application. It\ncreates a renderer and sets up some sensible defaults for you like antialiasing\nand color management. It also creates a default camera and provides the context\nin which your Threlte application will run. For improving access to this runtime\ncontext, it’s best practice [/docs/learn/basics/context] to create a seperate\ncomponent called Scene.svelte and including it in our App.svelte file.\n\nAt this point we’re looking at a blank screen. Let’s add a simple cube to it.\n\nIn Scene.svelte, we’re importing the <T> component [/docs/reference/core/t]\nwhich is the main building block of your Threlte application. It’s a generic\ncomponent that we use to render any Three.js object. In this case we’re creating\na THREE.Mesh [https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh] which is\nmade up from a THREE.BoxGeometry\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry] and a\nTHREE.MeshBasicMaterial\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial].\n\nWe should now be looking at a white cube on a transparent background.\n\nBehind the scenes we’re using the property attach available on <T> to attach an\nobject to a property of its parent. Binding geometries to the property geometry\nand materials to the property material is a common pattern so Threlte takes care\nof it for you.\n\nLearn more\n\nWe’re using the property attach available on <T> to attach an object to a\nproperty of its parent. In our case we’re attaching the underlying Three.js\nobject of <T.BoxGeometry> to the property geometry of the <T.Mesh> component.\nWe’re also attaching the underlying Three.js object of <T.MeshBasicMaterial> to\nthe property material of the <T.Mesh> component.\n\nBinding geometries to the property geometry and materials to the property\nmaterial is a common pattern so Threlte will take care of it. It checks for the\nproperties isMaterial and isGeometry on the underlying Three.js object and\nattaches it to the correct property.\n\nThree.js equivalent\n\nThat cube is still a bit boring. Let’s add some color to it, and make it a bit\nbigger! We also want to move it up a little to highlight it. We can do this by\npassing props to the <T> component.\n\nThrelte automatically generates props for <T> based on the underlying Three.js\nobject. This means you can easily guess most <T> props based on the Three.js\ndocs\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene]\nfor the class you are using.\n\nThe special args prop we use in <T.BoxGeometry> corresponds to the object’s\nconstructor arguments. Props interpreted from the underlying Three.js object are\ncalled auto props, like color in our <T.MeshBasicMaterial>. Leveraging Svelte’s\nPierced Props you can directly assigned to attributes of props like position.y\nin our <T.Mesh>.\n\nLearn more\n\nIn Three.js objects are classes that are instantiated. These classes can receive\none-time constructor arguments (new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32)). In Threlte,\nconstructor arguments are always passed as an array via the prop args. If args\nchange later on, the object must naturally get reconstructed from scratch!\n\nFor all other props, Threlte tries to automatically interpret props passed to\n<T> component.\n\nStep 1. Find Properties - First, Threlte will try to find the property on the\nunderlying Three.js object based on the name of the prop. In our example, color\nis a property of THREE.MeshBasicMaterial\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial.color].\n\nStep 2. Try set Methods - Next, Threlte will look for a set method on that\nproperty and use it to set the new value. In our example it will call\nmaterial.color.set('hotpink') to set the color of our material.\n\nStep 3. Try setting the property directly - If there’s no set method, it will\ntry to set the property directly.\n\nStep 4. Check for array values - When setting a property that accepts more than\none value (such as a THREE.Vector3: vec3.set(1, 2, 3)), we can pass an array as\na prop.\n\nBecause the property position of our THREE.Mesh is a THREE.Vector3, it also has\nx, y and z properties which we can set directly via dot-notation, we call this\nPierced Props.\n\nThree.js equivalent\n\nFrom a performance perspective, it’s often better to use pierced props because\nprimitive [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive] prop\nvalues can safely be compared for equality. This means that if the value of a\nprop doesn’t change, Threlte will skip any updates to the underlying Three.js\nobject.\n\nWe’re still staring at the side of a cube, let’s add a camera and offset it from\nthe center:\n\nWe’re again using the <T> component to create a THREE.PerspectiveCamera\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera]. We’re\nalso passing a makeDefault prop which will make this camera the default camera\nof our application. The renderer now uses this camera to render our scene.\n\nThrelte supports listening to certain events on <T> components\n[/docs/reference/core/t#events]. Here, we use the create event to get a\nreference to the underlying Three.js object as soon as it’s created and use the\nmethod lookAt to look at the cube.\n\nLet’s say we want to scale our cube as soon as we hover over it. We first have\nto import the plugin [/docs/learn/advanced/plugins] interactivity\n[/docs/reference/extras/interactivity] from @threlte/extras\n[/docs/reference/extras/getting-started] and invoke it in our Scene.svelte file;\nWe can now add interaction event listeners to our <T> components. We will add\npointerenter and pointerleave event listeners to our cube. In the event handlers\nwe’ll update the value of a Svelte spring store and apply the stores value to\nthe property scale of the component <T.Mesh>.\n\nYou might have noticed that we’re only passing a single number to the prop scale\non <T.Mesh>. Threlte automatically figures out whether you are passing an array\nor a number and uses the appropriate underlying Three.js method.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe component <T> will first look for a property setScalar on the underlying\nThree.js object and use that method if only a single number is passed. This is\nequivalent to calling scale.setScalar($scale).\n\nWhen working with realtime apps where variables e.g. position and rotation\nchange constantly, an easy way observe the values is with live expressions\n[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/live-expressions/].\n\nLet’s add some motion to our cube. We will use Threlte’s useFrame\n[/docs/reference/core/hooks#useFrame] hook to tap into Threlte’s unified frame\nloop and run a function on every frame. We again use a Pierced Prop to let the\ncube rotate around its y-axis.\n\nuseFrame registers a callback that will be invoked on every frame. The function\nreceives two arguments: the current state of the Threlte application (the same\ncontext available via the useThrelte [/docs/reference/core/hooks#useFrame]) and\nthe time delta since the last frame. We use the delta to update the rotation\nindependent of the frame rate\n[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame]\n– the cube will rotate at the same speed regardless of the frame rate.\n\nWe’re almost done. Let’s add some shading to our cube and a light source. We’ll\nuse a THREE.MeshStandardMaterial on our cube and a THREE.DirectionalLight to\nilluminate our scene.\n\nWe would like our cube to cast a shadow. To do so, we need a floor for it to\ncast a shadow on, so we add a new <T.Mesh> but this time with\n<T.CircleGeometry>.

It does this by leveraging the rigid three.js naming and object\nproperty structure to add and remove objects to and from the scene graph, attach\nobjects to parent object properties or add event listeners.\n\n<T> is the main building block of any Threlte application. Components available\nin '@threlte/extras' are built on top of <T> and may provide a more convenient\nAPI for specific three.js classes.\n\nPrimer on Terminology\n\nThere are two ways to use <T>:\n\nBoth ways are equivalent and can be used interchangeably. The latter is more\nexplicit and allows you to use any class definition (even if it’s not exported\nfrom Three.js’ main namespace 'three'), object instance or virtually any other\nvalue.\n\nThe next section will discuss both ways in more detail.\n\nAny three.js class available at Three.js’ main namespace 'three' can be used as\na component with full type-safety. The name of the import is the same as the\nname of the component. For example, the class THREE.Mesh can be used with the\ncomponent <T.Mesh>. Let’s take a look at a simple example:\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nIf you want to use a class that is not available at Three.js’ main namespace\n'three' with dot-notation, you can extend the default component catalogue. Be\naware that components used this way do not offer type-safety. Once extended, the\nupdated catalogue is available to all components in your application.\n\nTo explicitly pass a class definition to the component <T>, use the property is.\nLet’s take a look at the same example as above but using the property is:\n\nThe two examples are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.\n\nThe “vanilla” Three.js equivalent of both examples would be:\n\nUsing the property is comes in handy when using classes that are not exported\nfrom Three.js’ main namespace 'three', such as the OrbitControls class:\n\nIf a class definition such as THREE.Mesh is provided to the property is, it\ncreates an instance of that class which we call ref – the component’s reference\nto the three.js object:\n\nIf a class instance (such as new THREE.Mesh()) or any other value is provided,\nthe component uses this value as-is:\n\nDepending on the is property value types, Threlte makes certain assumptions:\n\nThe <T> component has a set of fixed props (namely args, is, attach, manual,\nmakeDefault and dispose) that are used to set up the Three.js object. On top of\nthat, you can use arbitrary props to reactively set any property of the\nunderlying Three.js object.\n\nTo understand how it works, let’s have a look at a simple example. Let’s say we\nwant to render a simple cube. We can do this by using the <T> component:\n\nUsing attachments [/docs/reference/core/t#attach], the geometry as well as the\nmaterial are assigned to the mesh. What if we want to change the color of the\nmaterial to \"red\"? We can do this by using the color prop:\n\nKeep in mind that this property is not hard-wired. We can use any property of\nthe underlying Three.js object as a prop on the <T> component. For example, we\ncan also set the position property of the THREE.Mesh:\n\nBecause the property position of a THREE.Mesh is a THREE.Vector3 the value we\nhave to provide is what is passed to the set function of the THREE.Vector3\nclass. In this case, we pass an array of three numbers ([x, y, z]). Using an\neditor like VS Code, you benefit from type hints and auto-completion.\n\nWe only changed the y coordinate of the position, so we can use a pierced prop\nto only change the y coordinate:\n\nThis way, we get less updates of the underlying Three.js object because the\nvalue of the prop is a primitive value which can easily be compared to the\nprevious value. Unfortunately with pierced props we miss out on the type hints\nand auto-completion.\n\nThree.js objects are class instances. When Instantiating these objects, they can\nreceive one-time constructor arguments (new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32)). In\nThrelte, constructor arguments are always passed as an array via the property\nargs. If args change later on, the object must naturally get reconstructed from\nscratch!\n\nUse attach to bind objects to their parent. If you unmount the attached object\nit will be taken off its parent automatically.\n\nThe following attaches a material to the material property of a mesh and a\ngeometry to the geometry property:\n\nAll objects ending with “Material” (such as MeshStandardMaterial) receive\nattach=\"material\", and all objects ending with “Geometry” receive\nattach=\"geometry\" automatically. You do not strictly have to type it out!\n\nBy default Threlte is responsive and will set up cameras properly on resize\n(aspect ratio etc). Cameras can be controlled manually by setting manual to\ntrue. This will opt out of projection matrix recalculation when the drawing area\nresizes or other camera-related properties change.\n\nUse the property makeDefault to set a camera to the default rendering camera.\n\nA common mistake is to forget setting makeDefault. If you do not set a camera to\nbe the default camera, the scene will not be rendered through this camera but\nthrough Threltes default camera.\n\nAdding an event listener to a component will also add the corresponding event\nlistener to the three.js class instance. The event will be forwarded and the\nnative payload is available as the first argument to the event listener.\n\nFor easier payload access as well as conforming to Three.js as much as possible,\nThrelte does not use Svelte’s CustomEvent<Payload> payload type. Instead, the\npayload is provided as is.\n\nThis will listen to the “change” event on the THREE.OrbitControls:\n\nAll <T> components also emit the create event when the underlying three.js class\ninstance is created. This can be used to access the instance from the parent\ncomponent or do tasks on the objects upon creation. The event handler is called\nwith an object containing a reference to the object as well as a function\ncleanup that you may invoke with a callback to clean up after the object is\ndestroyed when the component unmounts or the args change.\n\nThe value infered from the property is is available as the slot prop ref:\n\nThe value infered from the property is is available as the binding ref:\n\nBy default when using the dot-notation to access Three.js objects (e.g.\n<T.Mesh>), Threlte will automatically import the corresponding class from the\nnamespance 'three'. If you want to use a custom class or classes from Three.js\nthat are available elsewhere (like OrbitControls), you can extend the default\ncatalogue with the extend function:\n\nBe aware that in this case <T> can’t provide type-safety on properties and\nevents. If you need type-safety, you can use the is property instead: <T\nis={CustomMesh} />.

These abstractions provide extra\nfunctionality like automatically invalidating the frame or providing default\nvalues or extra props.\n\nA common use case for custom abstractions is to create a component that is a\nfixed entity in your Threlte app which you want to reuse in multiple places. As\nan example, let’s create a component that is made up from multiple <T>\ncomponents resembling a floor and a cube on top:\n\nLet’s see what implementing that component looks like:\n\nThe <Tile> component is now available in the scene and can be reused as many\ntimes as you want.

Threlte supports wheel, click and\npointer events through the plugin interactivity from '@threlte/extras' as well\nas the create event and arbitrary three.js object events on objects that extend\nTHREE.EventDispatcher (like OrbitControls). Click, pointer and wheel events\ncontain the native browser event as well as the raycast event data (object,\npoint, distance and other data).\n\nThe create event is triggered when the underlying three.js object is created in\na <T> component.\n\nSome three.js objects dispatch events such as the OrbitControls. To listen for\nthese events, use a regular Svelte event listener. The following example uses\nthe change event from OrbitControls\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls]\nto invalidate the renderer when the camera is moved.\n\nTo add click, pointer and wheel events to your Threlte app, import the plugin\ninteractivity from '@threlte/extras' and call it in your main scene component.\n\nAll child components now receive events.\n\nThe following interaction events are available:\n\nAll interaction events contain the following data:\n\nPropagation works a bit differently to the DOM because objects can occlude each\nother in 3D. The intersections array in the event data includes all objects\nintersecting the ray, not just the nearest. Only the first intersection with\neach object is included. The event is first delivered to the object nearest the\ncamera, and then bubbles up through its ancestors like in the DOM. After that,\nit is delivered to the next nearest object, and then its ancestors, and so on.\nThis means objects are transparent to pointer events by default, even if the\nobject handles the event.\n\nevent.stopPropagation() doesn’t just stop this event from bubbling up, it also\nstops it from being delivered to farther objects (objects behind this one). All\nother objects, nearer or farther, no longer count as being hit while the pointer\nis over this object. If they were previously delivered pointerover events, they\nwill immediately be delivered pointerout events. If you want an object to block\npointer events from objects behind it, it needs to have an event handler as\nfollows:\n\neven if you don’t want this object to respond to the pointer event. If you do\nwant to handle the event as well as using stopPropagation(), remember that the\npointerout events will happen during the stopPropagation() call. You probably\nwant your other event handling to happen after this.\n\nIf no event target is specified, all event handlers listen to events on the\ndomElement of the renderer (which is the canvas element by default). You can\nspecify a different target by passing a target prop to the interactivity plugin.\n\nIt’s also possible to change the target at runtime by updating the store target\nreturned from the interactivity plugin.\n\nIn the event that your event target is not the same size as the canvas, you can\npass a compute function to the interactivity plugin. This function receives the\nDOM event and the interactivity state and should set the pointer property of the\nstate to the pointer position in normalized device coordinates as well as set\nthe raycaster up for raycasting.\n\nYou can filter and sort events by passing a filter to the interactivity plugin.\nThe function receives all hits and the interactivity state and should return the\nhits that should be delivered to the event handlers in the order they should be\ndelivered.\n\nTo access the interactivity state, you can use the useInteractivity hook in any\nchild component of the component that implements the interactivity plugin as\nfollows:\n\nwhere this is the type of the interactivity state:\n\nCurrentWritable [/docs/reference/core/utilities#currentwritable] is a custom\nThrelte store.

In Threlte, you can just\nuse the <OrbitControls> component and it will automatically use the default\ncamera and the <canvas> element the renderer is rendering to. It will also\nautomatically invalidate the frame on demand.\n\nUnder the hood though, there’s still a regular <T> component that is doing the\nwork of applying props and registering event listeners. Internally,\n<OrbitControls> is forwarding all props and event listeners, so you can use it\njust like a regular <T> component.\n\nLet’s add an event listener that’s called when the camera is moved:\n\nThe event listener is forwarded to the <T> component and will be called when the\ncamera is moved. Keep in mind that these events are not hand-wired in the\ncomponent, but are forwarded to the underlying <T> component which in turn\nforwards them to the Three.js object. So you can use any event listener that is\nsupported by the <T> component.\n\nThe package also provides a few plugins [/docs/learn/advanced/plugins] that can\nbe used to extend the functionality of Threlte and <T> components.

For this guide, we’re going to use the GLTFLoader to load a .gltf\nmodel. In this section we’re also going to discuss a few things that are\nspecific to loading and caching models.\n\nWe start off by importing the GLTFLoader and useLoader hook:\n\nThen we can use the useLoader hook to load our model:\n\nAgain, the type of gltf is an AsyncWritable custom store. Its value will be\nundefined until the model has loaded. To use this model, we can use a\nconditional:\n\nWe included the <T> component here to add the model to our Threlte application\nbut immediately two problems arise:\n\nTo fix this, we’ll use Threlte’s CLI tool @threlte/gltf to generate a reusable\nSvelte component from our model.\n\nRun npx @threlte/gltf /path/to/model.gltf to generate a Svelte component from\nyour model. This will generate a file called Model.svelte in the same directory\nas your model. This is how a generated component looks like:\n\nThe generated component will still use the cache and will only reinstaniate\nparts of the model that make it reusable. This practice reduces network\nrequests, bandwidth, memory usage and improves the performance of your Threlte\napplication.\n\nYou can then import this component and use it in your application:\n\n@threlte/extras provides a handy hook for loading one-off .gltf models called\nuseGltf:\n\nKeep in mind that this hook caches the result and therefore is most suitable for\nloading models that are placed in the scene only once.\n\nTo start off, we import the TextureLoader from three and the useLoader hook from\n@threlte/core:\n\nThen we can use the useLoader hook to load our texture:\n\nThe type of texture is a custom store that Threlte provides called\nAsyncWritable. It’s very much like a regular Svelte store but with a few extra\nfeatures. Its value will be undefined until the texture has loaded.

This\nguide will help you migrate your Threlte 5 project to Threlte v6.\n\nThis document is a work in progress and will be updated up until the point of\nthe first release of Threlte 6. There are probably more breaking changes than\nlisted here. Your Editor will help you migrating with autocompletions and type\nchecking.\n\nPreprocessing is not needed anymore starting from Threlte 6. This means you may\nremove the preprocessor @threlte/preprocess from your project as well as its\nconfiguration in svelte.config.js. You can now use the component <T>\n[/docs/reference/core/t] directly.\n\nThrelte 6 merges the <Three> and <T> components into a single component. The\nproperty type was renamed to is to also properly reflect the fact that it can be\nused with already instantiated objects.\n\nThe @threlte/core package is now only about the <T> component. It does not\nprovide any abstractions that have been part of the core package before. Some of\nthese abstractions (<TransformControls>, <OrbitControls>, audio components and\nseveral hooks) have been moved to @threlte/extras as this is the new home for\ncommonly used abstractions.\n\nThrelte 6 heavily relies on prop types that Three.js naturally understands. As\nsuch, the prop types you may have previously used to define for example the\nposition of an object changed. Threlte v5 provided its own prop types Position\n(e.g. { x, y, z }), Rotation and others which are now removed or deprecated.\nWhile not yet all abstractions fully make use of the new prop types, we’re\nworking on it. Your editor should be able to provide you with the correct prop\ntypes for the components you’re using.\n\nInteractivity is now handled by a plugin that’s available at @threlte/extras.\nIt’s much more mature and flexible in terms of event handling. For instance – as\nsome of you requested – you may now define on what object the main event\nlistener is placed. Check out its documentation\n[/docs/reference/extras/interactivity] to learn more.\n\nThe hook useLoader [/docs/reference/core/hooks#useloader] now returns a custom\nSvelte store called AsyncWritable\n[/docs/reference/core/utilities#asyncwritable]. This store allows you to await\n[https://svelte.dev/tutorial/await-blocks] the loading of the resource while\nalso implementing a regular Svelte store. It also now caches the results of the\nloader function so that it’s not called multiple times for the same resource.\nYou will most likely benefit from quite a performance boost in applications that\nrely heavily on external resources.\n\nThe hook useThrelteRoot has been removed and its properties have partially been\nmerged into useThrelte as well as a new internal context which is not exposed.\nAll other contexts (which were used internally) have also been merged or\nremoved.\n\nIn the effort of clear separation of concerns, the component <Pass> as well as\nthe rendering with Three.js default EffectComposer have been removed. Threlte 6\nnow provides a hook called useRender [/docs/reference/core/hooks#userender]\nwhich allows you to easily set up sophisticated rendering pipelines. As soon as\na useRender hook is implemented, Threlte’s default render pipeline is disabled.\nuseRender callbacks will be invoked after all callback to useFrame have been\ninvoked. This means that you can use useFrame to update your objects and\nuseRender to render it. useRender also has the option of ordering callbacks to\norchestrate the rendering pipeline across multiple components.\n\nThelte’s main context contains Svelte stores. These stores are now a custom\nThrelte store called CurrentWritable\n[/docs/reference/core/utilities#currentwritable] which is a store that contains\na current value with a reference to the current value of the store. This means\nit does not need to be unwrapped manually (and expensively!) in non-reactive\nplaces such as loops. For instance, let’s have a look at its usage in the hook\nuseFrame [/docs/reference/core/hooks#useframe] where the context is available as\nthe first argument to the callback:\n\nThe full type definition is currently listed here\n[/docs/reference/core/hooks#usethrelte].\n\nThe signature of the hook useGltfAnimations has changed. It no longer provides a\ncallback that is invoked when the gltf store has been populated and the actions\nstore has been set. This is because it with the option to set a custom root for\nthe THREE.AnimationAction, the callback could be triggered multiple times,\nleading to an unpredictable behavior. You should reside to using the actions\nstore returned from the hook instead.\n\nCheck out the hooks documentation [/docs/reference/extras/use-gltf-animations]\nfor more information.\n\nIn an effort to clearly separate concerns, the components <Collider>,\n<AutoColliders> and <RigidBody> no longer offer transform props (position,\nrotation, scale and lookAt).

If\nyou are unsure about Svelte, consult its Tutorial [https://svelte.dev/tutorial]\nfor a quick introduction. As for Threejs, make sure you at least glance over its\nofficial documentation [https://threejs.org].\n\nAs a first step we’re creating a new Svelte file called App.svelte where we are\nimporting the <Canvas> component [/docs/reference/core/canvas].\n\nThe <Canvas> component is the root component of your Threlte application. It\ncreates a renderer and sets up some sensible defaults for you like antialiasing\nand color management. It also creates a default camera and provides the context\nin which your Threlte application will run. For improving access to this runtime\ncontext, it’s best practice [/docs/learn/basics/context] to create a seperate\ncomponent called Scene.svelte and including it in our App.svelte file.\n\nAt this point we’re looking at a blank screen. Let’s add a simple cube to it.\n\nIn Scene.svelte, we’re importing the <T> component [/docs/reference/core/t]\nwhich is the main building block of your Threlte application. It’s a generic\ncomponent that we use to render any Three.js object. In this case we’re creating\na THREE.Mesh [https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh] which is\nmade up from a THREE.BoxGeometry\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry] and a\nTHREE.MeshBasicMaterial\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial].\n\nWe should now be looking at a white cube on a transparent background.\n\nBehind the scenes we’re using the property attach available on <T> to attach an\nobject to a property of its parent. Binding geometries to the property geometry\nand materials to the property material is a common pattern so Threlte takes care\nof it for you.\n\nLearn more\n\nWe’re using the property attach available on <T> to attach an object to a\nproperty of its parent. In our case we’re attaching the underlying Three.js\nobject of <T.BoxGeometry> to the property geometry of the <T.Mesh> component.\nWe’re also attaching the underlying Three.js object of <T.MeshBasicMaterial> to\nthe property material of the <T.Mesh> component.\n\nBinding geometries to the property geometry and materials to the property\nmaterial is a common pattern so Threlte will take care of it. It checks for the\nproperties isMaterial and isGeometry on the underlying Three.js object and\nattaches it to the correct property.\n\nThree.js equivalent\n\nThat cube is still a bit boring. Let’s add some color to it, and make it a bit\nbigger! We also want to move it up a little to highlight it. We can do this by\npassing props to the <T> component.\n\nThrelte automatically generates props for <T> based on the underlying Three.js\nobject. This means you can easily guess most <T> props based on the Three.js\ndocs\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene]\nfor the class you are using.\n\nThe special args prop we use in <T.BoxGeometry> corresponds to the object’s\nconstructor arguments. Props interpreted from the underlying Three.js object are\ncalled auto props, like color in our <T.MeshBasicMaterial>. Leveraging Svelte’s\nPierced Props you can directly assigned to attributes of props like position.y\nin our <T.Mesh>.\n\nLearn more\n\nIn Three.js objects are classes that are instantiated. These classes can receive\none-time constructor arguments (new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32)). In Threlte,\nconstructor arguments are always passed as an array via the prop args. If args\nchange later on, the object must naturally get reconstructed from scratch!\n\nFor all other props, Threlte tries to automatically interpret props passed to\n<T> component.\n\nStep 1. Find Properties - First, Threlte will try to find the property on the\nunderlying Three.js object based on the name of the prop. In our example, color\nis a property of THREE.MeshBasicMaterial\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial.color].\n\nStep 2. Try set Methods - Next, Threlte will look for a set method on that\nproperty and use it to set the new value. In our example it will call\nmaterial.color.set('hotpink') to set the color of our material.\n\nStep 3. Try setting the property directly - If there’s no set method, it will\ntry to set the property directly.\n\nStep 4. Check for array values - When setting a property that accepts more than\none value (such as a THREE.Vector3: vec3.set(1, 2, 3)), we can pass an array as\na prop.\n\nBecause the property position of our THREE.Mesh is a THREE.Vector3, it also has\nx, y and z properties which we can set directly via dot-notation, we call this\nPierced Props.\n\nThree.js equivalent\n\nFrom a performance perspective, it’s often better to use pierced props because\nprimitive [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive] prop\nvalues can safely be compared for equality. This means that if the value of a\nprop doesn’t change, Threlte will skip any updates to the underlying Three.js\nobject.\n\nWe’re still staring at the side of a cube, let’s add a camera and offset it from\nthe center:\n\nWe’re again using the <T> component to create a THREE.PerspectiveCamera\n[https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera]. We’re\nalso passing a makeDefault prop which will make this camera the default camera\nof our application. The renderer now uses this camera to render our scene.\n\nThrelte supports listening to certain events on <T> components\n[/docs/reference/core/t#events]. Here, we use the create event to get a\nreference to the underlying Three.js object as soon as it’s created and use the\nmethod lookAt to look at the cube.\n\nLet’s say we want to scale our cube as soon as we hover over it. We first have\nto import the plugin [/docs/learn/advanced/plugins] interactivity\n[/docs/reference/extras/interactivity] from @threlte/extras\n[/docs/reference/extras/getting-started] and invoke it in our Scene.svelte file;\nWe can now add interaction event listeners to our <T> components. We will add\npointerenter and pointerleave event listeners to our cube. In the event handlers\nwe’ll update the value of a Svelte spring store and apply the stores value to\nthe property scale of the component <T.Mesh>.\n\nYou might have noticed that we’re only passing a single number to the prop scale\non <T.Mesh>. Threlte automatically figures out whether you are passing an array\nor a number and uses the appropriate underlying Three.js method.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe component <T> will first look for a property setScalar on the underlying\nThree.js object and use that method if only a single number is passed. This is\nequivalent to calling scale.setScalar($scale).\n\nWhen working with realtime apps where variables e.g. position and rotation\nchange constantly, an easy way observe the values is with live expressions\n[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/live-expressions/].\n\nLet’s add some motion to our cube. We will use Threlte’s useFrame\n[/docs/reference/core/hooks#useFrame] hook to tap into Threlte’s unified frame\nloop and run a function on every frame. We again use a Pierced Prop to let the\ncube rotate around its y-axis.\n\nuseFrame registers a callback that will be invoked on every frame. The function\nreceives two arguments: the current state of the Threlte application (the same\ncontext available via the useThrelte [/docs/reference/core/hooks#useFrame]) and\nthe time delta since the last frame. We use the delta to update the rotation\nindependent of the frame rate\n[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame]\n– the cube will rotate at the same speed regardless of the frame rate.\n\nWe’re almost done. Let’s add some shading to our cube and a light source. We’ll\nuse a THREE.MeshStandardMaterial on our cube and a THREE.DirectionalLight to\nilluminate our scene.\n\nWe would like our cube to cast a shadow. To do so, we need a floor for it to\ncast a shadow on, so we add a new <T.Mesh> but this time with\n<T.CircleGeometry>. To enable shadows, we need to set castShadow on both the\nlight and our cube, and set receiveShadow on our new floor:\n\nCongratulations, you’ve just created your first Three.js scene with Threlte!
