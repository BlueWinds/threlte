The package `'@threlte/xr'` provides tools and abstractions to more easily create VR and AR experiences.

## Installation

npm install @threlte/xr
```

## Usage

<Tip type="experimental">
  `'@threlte/xr'` is early in development. It is possible there will be frequent breaking changes until it reaches 0.1.0.
</Tip>

### Setup

The following adds a button to start your session and controllers inside an XR manager to prepare your scene for WebXR rendering and interaction.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {3,11}+
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import { VRButton } from '@threlte/xr'
  import Scene from './scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>

<VRButton />
```

Then, in `scene.svelte`:
```svelte
<script>
  import { XR, Controllers, Hands } from '@threlte/xr'
</script>

<XR />
<Controllers />
<Hands />
```

This will set up your project to be able to enter a VR session with controllers and hand inputs added.

If you want hands, controllers, or any other objects to be added to your `THREE.Scene` only when the XR session starts, make them children of the `<XR>` component:

```svelte
<script>
  import { XR, Controllers, Hands } from 'threlte-xr'
</script>

<XR>
  <Controllers />
  <Hands />
</XR>
```
