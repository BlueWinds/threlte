<Tip type="experimental">
  **Threlte 6 is still in active development** and you should expect breaking changes. This version
  of Threlte is available as a preview release with the tag `next`. **While the installation guide
  in this section respects that, the examples throughout the rest of the documentation may not.**
</Tip>

Threlte consists of 5 packages which can be installed and used individually. `@threlte/core` and Three.js
itself are required for all projects while the other packages are optional.
[`@threlte/gltf`](/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) does not need to be installed separately as it
can be used with `npx`, the resulting Threlte components however require `@threlte/extras` to be installed.

## Choose the packages you want to use

<InstallGuide client:load />

## Configuration

### Adapt `vite.config.js`

If you are using Threlte with SvelteKit, adapt your Vite configuration to prevent `three` from being externalized for SSR by vites externalization step

```js {3-5} title=vite.config.js
const config = {
  // â€¦
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['three']
  }
}
```
