A remix of threejs' [PointerLockControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/PointerLockControls)
It uses the [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API)

### Why you might want to use this

From the Pointer Lock API MDN doc:

> Pointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen

TL;DR if you want to tie mouse movement to a threlte camera, and have it behave properly, then use this.

### When the pointer is locked/unlocked

- the pointer is locked on
- press 'Esc' to release pointer
- click/focus the environment to lock the pointer again
